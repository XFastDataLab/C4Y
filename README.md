# C4Y
C4Y is a novel distributed clustering index, based on the sampling theories: 
(1) The data of each distributed node is considered as a sample of the entire data set. Each sample should have similar data 
distribution, as well as category distribution, to the entire data set; 
(2) the centers of each category in all samples conform to Gaussian
distribution. Thus, the proposed metric works by determining the extent to which the centers of each category in different samples
conform to Gaussian distribution, and the degree of difference between those categories.

The C4Y program was compiled under Windows using matlab R2016b.
